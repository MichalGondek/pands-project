The Iris flower data set or also know as Fishers Iris data set named after its founder Ronald Fisher
is a dataset containing 150 samples of the iris flowers from three species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica 

Each of these samples includes four features which determine the measurements of
- Sepal Length 
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The Iris data set is used to study the relationship between flower measurements and their species.
It helps us determine which species a flower belongs to, based on the size of its petals and sepals.
This dataset was designed to predict the species of an Iris flower 
The dataset is approximated by the closest tree with some penalty for the excessive number of nodes, bending and stretching.
A technique called linear discriminant analysis can be used to accurately distinguish the 3 species from one another using only the sepal and petal measurements.
