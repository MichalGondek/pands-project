The Iris flower data set or also know as Fishers Iris data set named after its founder Ronald Fisher
is a dataset containing 150 samples of the iris flowers from three species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica 

Each of these samples includes four features which determine the measuements of
- Sepal Lenght
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width


The dataset is approximated by the closest tree with some penalty for the excessive number of nodes, bending and stretching.

This dataset was designed to predict the species of an Iris flower
